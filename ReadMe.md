# Agreement
this package bundles up a few core agreement / consensus algorithms


## which ones
probably some mixture of view-stamped replication, eventual some
byzantine agreement, paxo, multi-paxo, or at least my own personal
spin on various quorum and/or leader election based protocols

## Can I use it for X?
who knows! maybe, maybe not,


## what ghc versions will it support

the moment i realize my life gets much easier with something only in new
ghc, i'm going to drop older versions
with great haste :)
